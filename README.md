# Regression-Models

Sir Francis Galton studied the relationship between heights of parents and their children.His work showed that parents who were taller than average had children who were also tall but closer tothe average height. Similarly, parents who were shorter than average had children who were also shorter than average but less so than mom and dad. That is, they were closer to the average height. From one generation to the next the heights moved closer to the average or regressed toward the mean.
